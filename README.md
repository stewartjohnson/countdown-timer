# countdown-timer

Javascript countdown timer. [Load it directly in your browser][1].

## Why?

I like writing code for fun. This was an itch to scratch. I used it when I was
running tutorials for students at school to remind them just how close their
exam day was so they would feel a sense of urgency about hitting the books.
There are loads of similar timers/counters in javascript on the web, but this
one is mine.

## Objectives

* Easy to get going if you want to do something simple
* Self-explanatory configuration options
* Flexible to suit a number of use cases
* Self-contained: a single file (though I'm cheating a bit by using the Google 
  CDN for jQuery).
